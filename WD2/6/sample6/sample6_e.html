            A key to the future success is the skill of networking.</h2>
        <p>
            The four offered courses will equip students with the skill
            to quickly give shape to ideas by making full use of
            development environments, such as the Internet and 3D
            printers, through programming and working with other
            individuals and organizations.

        <p>
            The Faculty offers practical training classes spanning
            multiple years where students across the four courses
