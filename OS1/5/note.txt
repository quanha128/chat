strace keep track of system calls used when executing programs

#include <fcntl.h>
open(): open the file with specified path
        return a file descriptor ( >=0 for success). Later operations on this opened file is done by specifying this file descriptor
#include <unistd.h>
read(): read file from file descriptor
        read n bytes and store to buf (although n bytes may not always be read), return bytes read
        return 0 on eof
write(): write to file dpecified by file descriptor
        write data stored in buf at most n bytes, return bytes written
        all n bytes may not always be write
close(): close a file descriptor

#define STDIN_FILENO 0
#define STDOUT_FILENO 1
#define STDERR_FILENO 2
These file descriptor can be used without open()

For most POSIX API, returns -1 on error
strerror_r() turns errno to error message
