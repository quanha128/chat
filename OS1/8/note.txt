To efficiently use mutex, multiple mutex should be used
Giant lock: 1 mutex, inefficient
Fine-grained lock: multiple mutex, easy to get bugs

Deadlock: situation where threads wait for others to release resource, thus no advancement can be made
4 conditions:
    - Mutual exclusion (sol. make resources independent)
    - Hold and wait (trylock)
    - No preemption (trylock)
    - Circular wait (algorithm)
Break one of these conditions will guarantee deadlock from occuring
