memory is a valuable resource in embedded system
2 types of memory: RAM(r/w) and ROM(read-only)
-> vars in RAM, const and prog. codes in ROM
compiler places vars in different sections:
    .text section: ROM (const, codes)
    .bss section: RAM (global vars)
    .data section: vars on RAM, initial value on ROM (on start up, data is copied to RAM)
efficiently use RAM, as more RAMs means more money is cost
- change vars from .bss section to .text section by adding "const"
- aware of memory consumption on heap and stack spaces

arduino programs are made of setup() and loop()
setup(): function execute only once on start up
loop(): function execute repeatedly while the system is running

realtime OS (RTOS): mechanism to maximize resource usage of computer
- task creation:
    ID tskid = tk_cre_tsk(T_CTSK *ctsk);
    create a new task inside a program
    task ID is dynamically assigned by the OS, and returned from tk_cre_tsk
    the newly created task becomes DORMANT state
    stack size needs to be specified as no virtual mem is used

T_CTSK ctsk = {
    ctsk.exinf = NULL;                  //extra info
    ctsk.tskatr = TA_HLNG | TA_RNG0;    //task attribute
    ctsk.task = task;                   //task function
    ctsk.itskpri = 10;                  //initial priority
    ctsk.stksz = 4096;                  //stack size
}

- task function:
    void task(int stacd, void *exinf) {
        (task procressing);

        tk_ext_tsk();
    }

- starting a task:
    ER ercd = tk_sta_tsk(ID tskid, int stacd);
    make DORMANT state becomes READY
        if not in DORMANT state, error is returned
    the task priority becomes initial priority as specified in task creation
    stacd is passed as the first argument of the function
