I/O instruction set:
    - Port mapped
    - Memory mapped: use the same set of instruction as accessing memory
        + registers for controlling the device is assigned to memory address
            -> writing into memory == make keyboard, mouse,... to run
        + set of instruction has specific address range

By outputting H/L signals through CPU terminal, peripherals devices can be controlled
Casting a pointer to the specific memory address gives you access to that that address
    -> Peripherals can be programmed

Put "volatile" to force programs to access variables in correct order and timing

Clear bits: AND
Set bits: OR
